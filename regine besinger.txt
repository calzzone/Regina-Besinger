The numbers for the hemorrhagic transformation mean: 1 = yes, 2 = no hemorrhagic transformation.
All the times (durations) are stated in minutes.
These are the statistics I would like to have:

 1. Distribution of age (<=40, 41-59, >=60)
 2. Distribution of sex
 
 3. Medium duration: onset of symptom onset until presentation to Emergency department
 4. Medium duration: onset - cerebral CT
 5. Medium duration: onset – blood analysis
 6. Medium duration: onset – thrombolytic administration
 7. Medium duration: emergency presentation – treatment initiation
 
 8. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and NIHSS score at 1 hour
 9. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and NIHSS score at 2 hours
10. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and NIHSS score at 7 days
11. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and Rankin score at 3 months
12. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and Barthel index at 3 months
13. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until thrombolytic administration and rate of hemorrhagic transformation
 
14. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until the treatment and Rankin score at 3 months, in the different age groups
15. Correlation between medium duration of onset of symptoms until treatment and Barthel index at 3 months, in the different age groups
 

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me. My number: 0732925874.
Thank you in advance! 

Barthel Index score at 3 months = 100 (ID=319)
